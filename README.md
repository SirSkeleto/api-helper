# Installation and Setup

1. Install Python (3.9+)
2. Install flask-restful (through pip or some other means)
3. Open constants.py and fill out the missing entries (go to someone's twitter media page and look at the UserByScreenName and UserMedia requests, the graphql keys can be found in the request url, and the cookies and headers can be found where you'd expect)
4. python api.py
